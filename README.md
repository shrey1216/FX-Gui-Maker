# FX-Gui-Maker
FXGuiMaker is a Java program that simulates a GUI builder using a tree data structure. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to create, edit, and manage a tree of GUI components. Each node in the tree represents a GUI component such as a button, label, text area, hbox, or vbox. Users can navigate the tree, add child components, edit text content, delete components, and save the tree structure to a text file. The program offers features like loading from a file, printing the tree structure, cursor movement, and saving to a text file. FXGuiMaker is a valuable tool for designing and organizing complex graphical user interfaces efficiently.
